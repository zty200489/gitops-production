# Production Kubernetes Cluster IaC Repository

This repository serves as the **source of truth** for production Kubernetes clusters IaC management powered by [FluxCD](https://fluxcd.io/) and [GitLab Agent for Kubernetes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/).

All cluster configurations are version-controlled, reviewed, and automatically reconciled through pull-based continuous delivery, ensuring immutable infrastructure and audit-ready changes in production.
